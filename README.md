# PRODIGY_DS_05

Analyze aeroplane crash data to identify patterns related to crashes, weather etc.
## Overview
In this repository we tend to Aeroplane accident data to identify patterns related to crashes.

### DataSet
The dataset used for this project is  'Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv'. This dataset chronicles early aviation accidents from the early 20th century. It provides details such as the date, time, location, operator, aircraft type, registration, and outcomes (fatalities and ground casualties) for each incident. These historical records include notable events like the first recorded airplane fatality, dirigible explosions, and airship crashes, shedding light on the risks and challenges faced during the infancy of flight.
